# peyton_huber_coppock_2022/download_original.R
# Output: original/ (the deposited replication archive, not redistributed in this repo)
# Depends on: original_manifest.csv
# Description: Fetch the deposited archive from Harvard Dataverse and verify every file.
#   Run this once before running anything in maintained/. Re-running is free: files
#   already present with the right checksum are not downloaded again. The deposit is
#   93 MB across 20 files, most of it one SPSS file.
#
#   The manifest carries two checksums per file because they do not always agree.
#   md5_served is the MD5 of the bytes Dataverse returns for `?format=original`, which is
#   what this code was written against. md5_published is the checksum Dataverse displays.
#   Here all twenty agree, but they do not always: another deposit in this program carries
#   three published checksums that verify neither the original nor the derived tabular
#   file. Verification therefore runs against md5_served and any disagreement is reported
#   rather than hidden.
#
#   The file_persistent_id column is empty for this deposit. Harvard Dataverse minted no
#   file-level DOIs here, so the numeric dataverse_file_id is the only stable handle.
